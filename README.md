Age plays a crucial role in IVF success. A woman’s fertility declines with age, especially after 35, due to reduced egg quantity and quality. Younger women typically have higher success rates, while those over 40 may require more cycles or donor eggs. Despite this, modern IVF technologies like ICSI, embryo freezing, and genetic testing offer better outcomes. Trinity IVF Ahmedabad educates couples about age-related fertility changes and provides options tailored to age and health. Early consultation and fertility preservation, like egg freezing, can help younger women delay pregnancy while keeping their future options open. Age is not a barrier—but it is a factor to plan around.
